pscp problem when called from bash 

Hi,
using pscp from "cmd" in Windows woks well but when it is used from bash, host:path is not correctly interpreted, it needs to add an additional / before the path to be well interpreted.
For example:
pscp -v myFile mylogin@myHost:/tmp/myDir
gives messages
Looking up host "myHost;C"
ssh_init: Host does not exist

pscp -v myFile mylogin@myHost://tmp/myDir
works well (with message
Looking up host "myHost")
